# 100 day moving average
apple['100ma'] = apple['Adj Close'].rolling(window=100, min_periods=0).mean()
# The rolling function stacks a specific amount of entries, in order to make a statistical calculation possible.
# The window parameter is the one which defines how many entries we are
# going to stack. But there is also the min_periods parameter. This one defines
# how many entries we need to have as a minimum in order to perform the
# calculation. This is relevant because the first entries of our data frame wonâ€™t
# have a hundred previous to them. By setting this value to zero we start the
# calculations already with the first number, even if there is not a single
# previous value. This has the effect that the first value will be just the first
# number, the second one will be the mean of the first two numbers and so on,
# until we get to a hundred values. By using the mean function, we are obviously calculating the arithmetic
# mean. However, we can use a bunch of other functions like max, min or
# median if we like to.
apple.dropna(inplace=True)
# We do this by using the dropna function. If we would have had any entries
# with NaN values in any column, they would now have been deleted.
